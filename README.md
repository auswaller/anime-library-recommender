# anime-library-recommender

## Description  

This website is a combination of a anime search, a randomizer, and personal library. The website has a search function which allows you to find an anime just by searching its name and information about the anime will show up. The randomizer when clicked will search through a massive directory and will give you a anime to watch as well as information about the anime. There is a library which you can add shows to.
